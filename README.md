# Automated Pricing System Development Process

In today’s competitive e-commerce market, dynamic pricing strategies are crucial for driving sales and maximizing profit. In this project we developed an automated pricing system using machine learning and data analysis techniques to modify product prices based on various factors such as competitor pricing, user traffic, product lifecycle and its sales. The system will increase prices during periods of high demand and new product releases, while reducing prices during low sales periods or as products approach the end of their market trend. It will also adjust pricing to attract price-sensitive customers by monitoring competitors’ pricing and reduce price if season offer is applied. The system will be integrated into an optimized e-commerce website to update prices in real time. The project objective is to streamline pricing process and maintain competitive pricing while reducing cost and time caused by manpower.
